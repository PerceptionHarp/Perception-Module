# Gender Classification
This repository contains the Gender Classification System developed for a Humanoid Assistance Robot. The system uses a deep learning model to classify gender in real time from a video feed, enabling the robot to provide personalized assistance and improve human-robot interaction.

## Features 🚀

* Real-time gender classification using a trained deep learning model.

* Optimized with TensorFlow Lite / YOLOv8 (depending on your final setup).

* Integrated with OpenCV for video streaming and frame processing.

* Can be extended for age detection, emotion recognition, and action recognition for more intelligent interaction.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

* Language: Python 3.x

* Frameworks & Libraries:

* Ultralytics YOLOv8 / TensorFlow Lite

* OpenCV

* NumPy
