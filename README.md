# Gender Classification
This repository contains the Gender Classification System developed for a Humanoid Assistance Robot.
The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify gender in real-time from a live video feed captured by the RealSense camera. By integrating this deep learning model, the robot is able to recognize gender with high accuracy, allowing it to deliver personalized assistance and enhance the overall human-robot interaction experience.

## Features üöÄ

* Real-time gender classification using a trained deep learning model.

* Optimized with TensorFlow Lite / YOLOv8 (depending on your final setup).

* Integrated with OpenCV for video streaming and frame processing.

* Can be extended for age detection, emotion recognition, and action recognition for more intelligent interaction.
